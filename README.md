Application Programming Assignment
I have built a website that contains links to various COVID 19 resources and FAQs regarding COVID 19 Vaccination.
This website is developed by Aviral Verma for Application Programming Project.

This website contains all the data sources and FAQs related to COVID 19.
If there is a problem viewing this website then checkout the following URL:
https://covinfo.aviral.live/
https://eloquent-goldwasser-0a4ea4.netlify.app/

The vaccination and COVID 19 statistics are static but the links to the resources are up to date.
The FAQs are constructed using the information available at https://www.cowin.gov.in/faq as on 5th May, 2021
